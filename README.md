# Win10IoT-AzureIotHub-SmartLampIn this project, I put together a real-world working project that shows how we can create an IoT device based on *Raspberry Pi 2*, with *Windows 10 IoT Core* OS. It's basically a smart lamp, that's controllable (switched on/off) remotely and able to send wattage telemetry. It's written in *Node.js*, and leverages *Azure IoT Hub* for collecting telemetry data and control the device.Components:* Raspberry Pi 2 with Windows 10 IoT Core* Solid state AC switch circuit (will detail it later)* AC current sensor ACS712* ADC Chip MCP3008##Azure IoT HubYou need to have [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/iot/) account in order to try control device remotely and sending wattage. After you setup an Azure IoT Hub container, you should change `[IOT HUB CONNECTION STRING]` in `server.js` file with appropriate connection string. Refer to [Azure IoT Hub documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-hub-devguide/) on how to get that connection string.## BonusFor reading wattage used by the lamp, I need to read the used current. For that I use current sensor (ACS712). However, as we know, Raspberry can't read analog data from current sensor. For that, I use ADC chip called MCP3008.Inside the project, you'll find a class to read analog data from MCP3008 via SPI.
